# A number guessing game with a user-specified range.


# Import the random module.

# Tell the user to enter the maximum number.

# Read the maximum number from the user.

# Choose a random number between 1 and the maximum.

# Calculate the number of guesses to give the user as log(max) / log(2) + 1.

# Do the following for the number of times the user can guess:

	# Tell the user how many guesses he has left.

	# # Prompt the user for a number and read it. This is his guess.

	# If the guess is correct:

		# Tell the user that he won.

		# End the program.

	#  Otherwise, if the guess is too high:

		# Tell the user his guess was too high.

	#  Otherwise, if the guess is too low:

		# Tell the user his guess was too low.

# All guesses are used up. Tell the user he lost the game.
